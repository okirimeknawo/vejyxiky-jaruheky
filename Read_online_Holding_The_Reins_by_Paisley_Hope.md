Overview
To hold the reins idiom; metaphor To be in charge of, to be in complete control of; yourself, a situation, people or all of the above. Cecilia &quot;CeCe&quot; Ashby is finally escaping the toxic relationship that has consumed her entire adult life.. She returns to her hometown of Laurel Creek, Kentucky and her family&#039;s equestrian ranch unsure of what the future holds. It&#039;s time to move on, she just has no idea where to start. Nash Carter is the newly retired superstar of the Dallas Stars, Laurel Creek&#039;s hometown hero, local business owner and notorious bachelor. He&#039;s also the unofficial fourth sibling in the Ashby clan. It&#039;s been years since his days of tormenting and protecting CeCe with her older brothers Wade and Cole, but when CeCe returns to town unexpectedly and needs a job, he knows he has to have her and not entirely for business. In fact, Nash can&#039;t seem to take his eyes off of his best friend&#039;s much younger, vulnerable little sister and it seems she&#039;s been staring right back. Despite the many self-proclaimed reasons why they would never work, the fire between them ignites and they form a little pact of rules before jumping into the flames. As &#039;just one night&#039; turns into many, Nash quickly learns that where CeCe Ashby is concerned his typical rules simply don&#039;t apply. Now he has to figure out if he can push his past trauma aside enough to have the life he never expected to want. A life he&#039;s both terrified to live and terrified to lose. All he has to do to have it all? Take a deep breath and let go of the reins.
