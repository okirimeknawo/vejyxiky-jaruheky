An ordinary man who was living an imperfect life, Andy Bui opened his heart to faith and transformed into someone who strives to live well, finding the courage to pursue perfection.
 How did he transition from drugs, gambling, and other addictions‚Äîa life masked with lies and deceit‚Äîto pursuing a righteous path free of sin and judgment?
 The Courage to Live a Meaningful Life addresses that question head on and details Bui&amp;#039;s remarkable metamorphosis. It lays bare his missteps and confronts life&amp;#039;s contradictions and challenges. It&amp;#039;s his personal pledge to his family, friends, and community to live shame-free and not stray from the path.
 As depicted in this confessional and poetic memoir, Bui spent the first half of his life seeking to live. He is now pursuing his second life: learning how to die without sin. He has been reborn. By gaining control of his thoughts and emotions and cultivating positivity in every aspect of life, he leads a meaningful existence and finds purpose in his relationship with God. If he can do it, you can, too!
