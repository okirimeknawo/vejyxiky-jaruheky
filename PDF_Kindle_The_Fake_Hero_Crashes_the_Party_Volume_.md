Overview
Foyle may have been denied the role of hero, but that doesnâ€™t mean he canâ€™t be a savior. Having changed his name to Ayame, heâ€™s on a journey to save as many people as possible, accompanied by Iris, an elf with legendary healing powers. 
 When Ayame and Iris arrive in the city of Rikko, they find preparations are underway for the Full Bloom Festival. The pair teams up with the Adventurerâ€™s Guild as they hunt a dragon to gain the rare materials needed for the festivalâ€™s stunning fireworks display that will light up the night sky. 
 Unfortunately, the festivities have invoked the envy of Sway Ka Senco (a member of the fearsome Eight Warlords) whoâ€™s determined to ruin the fun. With powerful ice magic that threatens to freeze the entire city and its peopleâ€”their flesh, their souls, and the very ground beneath them includedâ€”Warlord Sway Ka Senco looks to be Ayameâ€™s toughest opponent yet.
