This book looks at the question of whether Celtic cultural fairies can be found in North America by exploring folklore across the last four hundred years through today. Stories of belief and personal encounters from Canada, the US, and Mexico show the flexibility of fairy belief and the way that these beings and ideas adapt to new places and times as they are carried along with the people who believe in them. Perfect for anyone who ever wondered if Celtic fairies can be found outside of Europe, what those appearances may be like, and what people have believed and do believe about fairies in diasporic communities. Fairy beliefs survived thousands of years of attempted suppression by religious groups. Celtic Fairies in North AmericaÂ shows that they survived and adapted to emigration, immigration, and the influences of popular culture.
