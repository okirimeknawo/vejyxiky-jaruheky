Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller An unprecedented look into the life of Taylor Swift, told by the only journalist close enough to tell it. This is a must-have for any Swifties looking for the next great insight into her stardom. An intimate look at the life and music of modern popâ€™s most legendary figure, Taylor Swift, from leading music journalist Rob Sheffield. A cultural phenomenon. A worldwide obsession. An agent of emotional chaos. Thereâ€™s no parallel to Taylor Swift in history: a teenage girl who turns into the worldâ€™s favorite pop star, songwriter, storyteller, guitar hero, live performer, changing how music is made and heard. An all-time great on the level of The Beatles, Prince, or David Bowie. Heartbreak Is the National Anthem: How Taylor Swift Reinvented Pop MusicÂ is the first book thatÂ goes deep on the musical and cultural impact of Taylor Swift.Â Nobody can tell the story like Rob Sheffield, the bestselling and award-winning author ofÂ Dreaming the Beatles,Â On Bowie, andÂ Love Is a Mix Tape.Â The legendary Rolling Stone journalist is the writer who has chronicled Taylor for every step of her long career, from her early days to the Eras Tour. Sheffield gets right to the heart of Swift and her music, her lyrics, her fan connection, her raw power. At once one of the most beloved music figures of the past two decades and one of the most criticized, Taylor Swift is known as much for her life beyond her music as she is for her hitsâ€”the most public of stars, yet also the weirdest and most mysterious. In the tradition of Sheffieldâ€™sÂ Dreaming the Beatles,Â Heartbreak Is the National AnthemÂ will inform and delight a legion of fans who hang on every word from Taylor and every word Rob writes on her.
