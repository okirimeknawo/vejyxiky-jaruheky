War came and left. But no one made it out. Not really. Ruth, though valiant in heart, battles the worst of her demons yet. Unable to cope, she unwittingly presents Warrose with the challenge of bringing her back to life despite the darkness that now infects her mind. How far will one man go to deliver the woman he pines for from hell and back to the throne that calls her name? Marilynn must follow in the footsteps of the prophecy. The one that she must bear secrets to alone. With the misogynistic Demechnef laws that stifle women, it&amp;#039;s up to her and the man who carries the heart of gold to change the laws written. And with the Demechnef heir along the way, Niles has never gleamed so bright. From lambs into lions, this is only the beginning of a new era to come. Triggers: Accessibility issues, emotional distress, Infantilization, Loss of independence and dignity, suicidal thoughts, bullying, traumatic flashbacks, torture, depression, gore, sexism, eating disorder, mention of animal cruelty (off page), animal death, disturbing imagery, infantilization, graphic violence and gore, sexism and misogyny, self-deprecating language or negative self-talk, mention of kidnapping, mental health issues, sexually explicit content. Do not continue if you are unsure of the contents of this book.
