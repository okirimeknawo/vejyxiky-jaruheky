Overview
Lambda Literary award winner and national bestselling author Alexandria Bellefleur returns with a steamy sapphic rom-com about a quiet bookseller and a romance novel cover model who agree to a modern-day marriage of convenience... Tansy Adamsâ€™ greatest love is her familyâ€™s bookstore, passed down from her late father. But when it comes to actual romanceâ€¦ Tansy canâ€™t get past the first chapter. Tired of her stepfamilyâ€™s questions about her love life, Tansy invents Gemma, a fake girlfriend inspired by the stunning cover model on a bestselling book. Theyâ€™ll never actually meet, so whatâ€™s the harm in a little fib? Yet when real-life Gemma crosses Tansyâ€™s path, her white lie nearly implodes. Gemma van Dalen is a wild child, the outcast of her wealthy family, and now the latest heir to Van Dalen Publishing. But the title comes with one tiny condition: she must be married in order to inherit. When Gemma discovers a beautiful stranger has been pretending to date her for months, she decides to take the charade one step furtherâ€”and announces their engagement. Gemma needs a wife to meet the terms of her grandfatherâ€™s will and Tansy needs money to save her struggling bookstore. A marriage could be mutually beneficial, if they can fool everyone into thinking itâ€™s a love match. Unexpected sparks fly as Tansy and Gemma play the role of affectionate fiancÃ©es, and suddenly the line between convenient arrangement and real feelings begins to blur. But the scheming Van Dalen family wonâ€™t give up the company without a fight, and Gemma and Tansyâ€™s newfound happiness might get caught in the falloutâ€¦Â Â Â Â Â Â
