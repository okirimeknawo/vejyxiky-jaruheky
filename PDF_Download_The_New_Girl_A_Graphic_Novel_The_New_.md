Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller Centering on the difficulties of change and its many heads, The New Girl is about one young girl and her family, trying to make it in America. Despite serious themes, this is nonetheless as fun as they come, carrying a great sense of humor throughout Lia&#039;s search for herself. Instagram sensation and Tapas webcomic superstar Cassandra Calin makes her long-form debut with this funny, feel-good middle-grade graphic novel about change. Goodbye, old life... Lia and her family are waiting to board a flight across the Atlantic, leaving behind family, friends, and Romania â€” the only home Lia has ever known. But Lia&#039;s heartache is overshadowed by the discomfort of her first period. As if things weren&#039;t difficult enough! Now Lia is thrust into a world where everything is different: her home, her language, and even her body. With so many changes happening at once, Lia struggles with schoolwork, has trouble communicating with classmates, and has no idea how to manage her unpleasant periods. Will she ever feel like herself again? Inspired by the author&#039;s own immigration experience, The New Girl is a comically charming story about change and acceptance.
