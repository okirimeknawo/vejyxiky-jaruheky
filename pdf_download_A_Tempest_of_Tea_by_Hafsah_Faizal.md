Notes From Your Bookseller Itâ€™s a heist story with vampires from Hafsah Faizal, and if that isnâ€™t enough to get you hooked, consider that itâ€™s just the first in a duology that promises all the stakes and tension set on a stage populated by characters youâ€™ll quickly learn to love. The B&amp;amp;N exclusive edition includes an alternate cover, unique case and case stamp, and designed endpapers. From Hafsah Faizal, New York Times-bestselling author of We Hunt the Flame, comes the first book in a hotly-anticipated new fantasy duology about an orphan girl and her crew who get tangled in a heist with vampires, perfect for fans of Leigh Bardugo&amp;#039;s Six of Crows. On the streets of White Roaring, Arthie Casimir is a criminal mastermind and collector of secrets. Her prestigious tearoom transforms into an illegal bloodhouse by night, catering to the vampires feared by society. But when her establishment is threatened, Arthie is forced to strike an unlikely deal with an alluring adversary to save itâ€”she canâ€™t do the job alone.
 
 Calling on some of the cityâ€™s most skilled outcasts, Arthie hatches a plan to infiltrate the sinister, glittering vampire society known as the Athereum. But not everyone in her ragtag crew is on her side, and as the truth behind the heist unfolds, Arthie finds herself in the midst of a conspiracy that will threaten the world as she knows it. Dark, action-packed, and swoonworthy, this is Hafsah Faizal better than ever.
