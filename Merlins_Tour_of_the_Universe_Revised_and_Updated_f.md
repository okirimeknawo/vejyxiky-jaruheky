Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller The universe is a big place. Best to see it with Neil deGrasse Tyson and his fictional chaperone Merlin as a guide. Traveling through space one question at a time, this is a lively and energetic exploration of the cosmos. The #1 New York Times bestselling author of Astrophysics for People in a Hurry takes readers on an entertaining and edifying tour of the universe. In Neil deGrasse Tysonâ€™s delightful journey through the cosmos, his fictional character Merlin responds to popular questions asked by adults and children alike. Merlin, a timeless visitor from Planet Omniscia in the Andromeda Galaxy, has observed firsthand many of the major scientific events of Earthâ€™s history. Merlinâ€™s friends include the most important scientific figures and explorers of all timeâ€”da Vinci, Magellan, Newton, Einstein, and Hubble. While Merlin occasionally recounts playful conversations with these luminaries, all questions are answered with authentic science, infused with wit, wisdom, and an occasional rhyme. With the help of intermittent humorous cartoons, Merlin clarifies the details of familiar phenomena like gravity, light, space, and time, and travels to distant stars and galaxies to describe what makes them tick, rotate, explode, and collapse. Merlinâ€™s Tour of the Universe is perfect for anyone who harbors burning questions on how the cosmos works.
